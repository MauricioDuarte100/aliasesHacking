# Recommended Zsh Plugins for Productivity and Pentesting

This file contains a list of recommended Zsh plugins to enhance your productivity and streamline your pentesting workflow.

## Installation

Most of these plugins can be installed using a Zsh plugin manager like [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen), or [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen).

To install a plugin with Oh My Zsh, you typically clone the plugin's repository into the `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` directory and then add the plugin's name to the `plugins` array in your `.zshrc` file.

Example:
```
